# doing some maths on the CLI

## `bc`

Simply run it.

```bash
bc
```

## `expr`

Test logical expressions.

```bash
expr 1 == 1
expr 1 == 2
expr 1 \& 0
```

## `factor`

Curious about prime factors of `1102`?

```bash
factor 1102
```

## `qalc`

Slightly fancier than `bc`.

```bash
qalc
```

Base 2 results.

```bash
qalc -b 2
```
